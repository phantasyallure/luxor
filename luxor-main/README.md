# Luxor Accessories

Accessories store — storefront + back-office, built with React, Vite and Supabase, deployed on Cloudflare (Workers, with `/functions/api` compiled into a single Worker script — see Deploy below).
Storefront languages: French, English, Arabic. Admin: French / English.

## What's inside

**Storefront (`/`)**
- Luxor Accessories signature wordmark in the header, royal green & beige theme. The homepage hero is a full-screen photo: `public/images/hero-desktop.jpg` (16:9, screens wider than 768px) and `public/images/hero-mobile.jpg` (9:16, phones). Replace either file to change the image.
- Accessory categories (bags, wallets, belts, jewelry, watches, sunglasses, hats, scarves, hair accessories, tech accessories, other).
- Colour dots under the price on every product card; on the product page the customer picks a colour (and a size) before ordering. **Clicking a colour switches the photo** to the one(s) you assigned to that colour (photos without a colour are shared and always shown).
- Facebook Pixel: `PageView` on every page, `ViewContent` on a product page, `Purchase` when an order is sent.
- TikTok Pixel: page view on every page, `ViewContent` on a product page, `CompletePayment` (TikTok's purchase event) when an order is sent.

**Admin (`/admin`)** — sidebar with Products, Orders, Stock, Analytics, Messages, Team, Settings
- **Products:** "Add product" opens a form (photos, name, price, category, colours, sizes, stock). Edit and delete too.
- **Reduced price (optional):** fill it in and the storefront shows the normal price crossed out, the reduced price, and a small red "Promotion" tab on the photo. Empty = no promotion. Orders record the price actually charged.
- **Delivery prices (per wilaya):** open **Livraison** in the admin and set one price per wilaya (or apply one price everywhere, then adjust). The customer sees the price as soon as they choose their wilaya, in a small Product / Delivery / Total summary above the order button. Empty = no fee shown, `0` = free delivery. The fee is recorded on each order.
- **Colour photos:** once a product has colours, each photo gets a small menu — pick which colour it shows, or leave "All colours" for a shared photo.
- **Use AI** on each photo removes its background (Gemini → OpenAI → remove.bg → Clipdrop; next one takes over when one hits its limit).
- **Optional stock:** each product has a "Track stock for this product" switch. Off = no quantity shown in the list, never "Sold out", no low-stock alerts, and accepted orders leave it alone. Untracked products are left out of the Stock page.
- **Stock:** low-stock highlighting at a threshold you choose, "only 1 left" warnings, live badge in the sidebar, +/- editing.
- **Orders:** Accept / Refuse buttons, filters, search, colour + size shown.
- **Analytics:** accepted vs refused vs pending (7 / 30 / 90 days), daily chart, status donut, top products, top wilayas, accepted revenue.
- **Team:** the owner creates accounts and ticks what each person may open (products, stock, orders, analytics, messages, settings).
- **Settings:** Facebook Pixel ID, TikTok Pixel ID and AI API keys.

## Setup

### 1. Supabase
1. Open **SQL Editor** and run `supabase/schema.sql`. It is safe on your existing database (products, orders and chat are kept) and can be re-run. **Re-run it after every update of this project** — the latest version adds the `sale_price` column and the `delivery_rates` table (reduced price and per-wilaya delivery prices) on top of `image_colors` (colour photos) and `track_stock` (optional stock).
2. **Project Settings > API**: copy the Project URL, the `anon` key and the `service_role` key.

### 2. Environment variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local work, and add the same variables in your Cloudflare project's **Settings > Variables and Secrets** — set them for both **Production** and **Preview**:

| Variable | Where it is used |
|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | browser (read at build time) |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | server functions only — same value as `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` (runtime; the `VITE_` one is not visible to the Worker) |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | server functions only (never prefix with `VITE_`) — add it as a **Secret** |
| `ADMIN_OWNER_EMAILS` | server, comma-separated allowlist of the only emails that can ever create the owner account |

### 3. Deploy
Push to GitHub (keep `package-lock.json` in the repo — Cloudflare installs with `npm ci`; `.node-version` pins Node 22, which Wrangler 4 requires), then in the Cloudflare dashboard: **Compute → Workers & Pages → Create application → Import a repository**, connect the repo, and configure:
- **Build command:** `npm run build:cf` (this runs `vite build`, then compiles `/functions/api/**` into a single Worker script — a plain `wrangler deploy` with no build command will NOT run either step, and the site will fail to load with a "MIME type" console error while `/api/*` silently 404s)
- **Deploy command:** leave as `npx wrangler deploy` (the default)
- **Cloudflare Workers keeps two separate lists.** `VITE_*` variables go under **Settings → Build → Variables and secrets** (read while building). `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `ADMIN_OWNER_EMAILS` and any AI keys go under **Settings → Variables and Secrets** (read by the running Worker). Then redeploy.

`wrangler.toml` in this repo already declares `nodejs_compat` (needed for `Buffer` in `remove-bg.js`) and points at the compiled output, so nothing else needs to be set for that.

Locally, use `npm run pages:dev` (plain `npm run dev` serves the storefront but not `/api`, so Team, AI and owner setup won't work). First run `npm install` so `wrangler` is available.

Custom domain: open the project → **Domains** tab → **Add Domain**. If the domain's DNS is already on Cloudflare this is one click; if not, Cloudflare will ask you to add a CNAME at your current DNS provider first.

### 4. First login
Open `/admin`. On a fresh install it shows **Create the owner account**: enter your email and password. This only works if that email is listed in `ADMIN_OWNER_EMAILS` on the server — anyone else hitting `/admin` gets a generic "not available" error, so the page can't be used to create unauthorized accounts. After the owner exists it is a normal login screen. The old PIN screen no longer exists.

### 5. Facebook Pixel, TikTok Pixel and AI
- **Settings > Facebook Pixel** and **Settings > TikTok Pixel:** paste each pixel ID (leave one empty to keep it off). They go live on the storefront immediately. Re-run `supabase/schema.sql` once so visitors are allowed to read the TikTok id.
- **Settings > AI background removal:** paste one or more API keys. Free Gemini key: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey. Keys are stored server-side and never sent back to the browser. You can also set `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `REMOVEBG_API_KEY`, `CLIPDROP_API_KEY` in the Cloudflare project's Settings > Variables and Secrets instead.

## Roles and permissions
- The **owner** can do everything and is the only one who sees **Team**.
- Staff accounts only see the sidebar entries they were given, and the database enforces it (row-level security), not just the interface.
- Someone with only **Stock** can change quantities but not prices or names.
- Suspending a member blocks them immediately; deleting removes their login.

## Things worth knowing
- **Statuses:** database values are unchanged (`new`, `contacted`, `confirmed`, `cancelled`). *Confirmed* is shown as **Accepted**, *cancelled* as **Refused**.
- **Stock and orders:** accepting an order takes 1 piece out of stock and un-accepting puts it back (turn it off in Stock > toggle). Existing stock numbers are not touched.
- **Old jewellery products** keep working; they show under "Other" until you edit their category.
- **AI background removal:** OpenAI, remove.bg and Clipdrop return a transparent PNG. Gemini returns the product on a plain white background (Gemini image output has no transparency). Image quotas and pricing are set by each provider; a key with no image quota simply falls through to the next one.
- **Support chat:** conversations are still readable by anyone holding the public anon key (unchanged from before). Worth tightening later with a proper session-scoped policy.
- Fonts are bundled (no Google Fonts request). Signature font: Mr De Haviland.
